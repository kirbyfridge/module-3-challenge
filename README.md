# Module 3 Challenge

## Password Generator

### Description

In this challenge, I created a strong password generator. That means that 
with each password, it can include lowercase & uppercase letters, 
numbers, and/or special characters if one desires! Also be between the 
user can choose their minimum & maximum password length (as long as it's 
between 8 to 128 characters in length) so it can perfectly fit the 
guidelines of any site. Press "Generate Password" & give it a try! 

The original starter code was created by Xandromus (thanks again!) where 
they have done the HTML, CSS, & part of the JavaScript but left the 
password generation unfinished. You can check out their code at the 
link below.

As you can see, this is after a random password has been generated!
